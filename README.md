# DK RabbitMQ messanger Sample Project

This project is a simple messaging application using RabbitMQ.

To get started with RabbitMQ, you need to install both <a href="https://www.erlang.org/downloads">Erlang</a> and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/download">RabbitMQ</a> on your local machine or another server. After installation, RabbitMQ can be accessed via its IP address and port number (default port: 5672).

Next, install the RabbitMQ client package by running the following command:

```
Install-Package RabbitMQ.Client
```

If you have any suggestions for improving this project, please feel free to share them.
